# Safety-Decision-Making-for-Autonomous-Vehicles-Integrating-Passenger-Physiological-States-by-fNIRS
Necessary data and code for reproduction of results and figures in the paper 'Safety Decision-Making for Autonomous Vehicles Integrating Passenger Physiological States by fNIRS'.

Because of the large file limits of GitHub, the original data of fNIRS collection are not uploaded to this repository. Therefore, in order to run the code for classifier training, please access the data via FigShare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28528001.v2). Copy the 'fNIRS Data Collection' folder and paste it under the same directory in this repository to run the classifier training code.
